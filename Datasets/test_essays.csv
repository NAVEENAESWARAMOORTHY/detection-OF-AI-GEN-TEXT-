weccl_45,WECCL-17,"Dear Principal,

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

The policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a B average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
weccl_46,WECCL-18,"Technology in society is constantly innovating and becoming more complex. Over time, different manufacturers have tried to create successful, driverless cars. People have mixed feelings towards this for many reasons including safety and control. However, these people are not thinking about the greater outcomes of what could happen with these innovative cars. Overall, driverless cars would be very beneficial to society and the world.

Driverless cars can open up many new windows for society. Companies like Google are already experimenting with this. Since there is not legislation completely prohibiting the use of semi-autonomous cars in California, Google has taken advantage of this by using their cars to aid them in mapping the world. They have used their driverless cars to help gain more info for Google Maps. Society will gain more information about the surrounding land. This is just one possibility with these new cars.

Along with gaining new information, driverless cars can help people multitask. This is also prevalent with Google Maps. As the car scans and takes pictures of the land around it, the person in the car is able to track down and record the appropriate data. People will be able to do more with driverless cars which is more efficient. This will benefit large companies as they will be able to do more with their time. However, for many this leads to problematic thoughts. People are in fear that these cars will have safety problems and that humans will lose control. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author discusses this possible problem thouroughly. There is common misconception that driverless cars will be completely automatic, but this is not the case. Driverless cars are more for assisting rather than they are for driving. The person in the car still needs to remain alert in cases where they might need to take over. This shows that the car does not have complete control.

Another major concern is whether or not these cars are entirely safe. In the article, the author also mentions how the in-car system itself is a safety feature. The article mentions how manufacturers hope to bring in in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Anytime the person needs to take over the car, these displays can be turned off instantly. This is something that is not availables to drivers who are texting while driving. This shows how these driverless cars may even be safer than regular, self-driven cars.

To conclude, one of the greatest reasons that society should move forward with this innovative idea is that this groundbreaking technology can be beneficial in fields outside of automobiles. If engineers can successfully create an automatic car, what else will they be able to produce? More automatic devices could be created with this technology. In this fast-paced world, emptying up time is incredibly beneficial as people will then be able to do greater things. This is something that has been proven to be true since the beginning of time. Innovations such as the printing press, for example, showed this. As technology took over the mundane task of handwriting papers, printers now had more time to complete their own duties. This lead to more efficiency as well as more time for newer innovations. This ultimately helps society as a whole, and this is why driverless cars need to become successful."

weccl_48,WECCL-20,"University education is a contentious issue, with some people believing that it's primary purpose is to prepare students for employment, while others believe it has other functions. In my opinion, university education has more than one purpose and should not be limited to preparing students for employment.

Firstly, university education is an opportunity for students to develop their knowledge and skills in a particular field. Through their studies, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and develop the skills necessary to excel in their chosen field. For example, a student studying engineering will learn the principles of engineering and develop the skills needed to design and build complex structures. This knowledge and skill set can be applied to a variety of different fields, from construction to robotics.

Secondly, university education is an opportunity for students to develop as individuals. Through their studies, students can learn to think critically and develop the skills necessary to solve complex problems. They can also develop their communication skills, which are essential in any career. Furthermore, university education can be a great way for students to network and build relationships with their peers, which can be beneficial in their future career.

Finally, university education can be a great way for students to explore their interests and passions. Students can take courses in a variety of different subjects and gain a better understanding of the world around them. This can open up new opportunities and help them to find a career path that they are truly passionate about.

In conclusion, university education has more than one purpose and should not be limited to preparing students for employment. It is an opportunity for students to develop their knowledge and skills, develop as individuals, and explore their interests and passions.

weccl_49,WECCL-21,"People ask for advice from others all the time. Sometimes people go to one person for advice, and at others they go to multiple people for advice. For a couple of different reasons, in order to make the best choice it is better to ask several people for advice rather than just one person.

One of the reasons that asking multiple people for advice can lead someone to making the best choice is when he/she hears several different opinions. Hearing these different opinions will allow he/she to choose which opinion is the best for the given situation. Where as if he/she only went to one person for his/her opinion, it may not be the best possible advice for the situation. That is just one way asking multiple people for advice can lead to the best decision.

weccl_54,WECCL-26,"Education is a life-long process. This is a statement that I strongly agree with. Education is not something that is confined to the four walls of a classroom, but rather something that can be experienced throughout life.

First of all, education is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills. It is also about developing our character and values. Education helps us to become better people by teaching us how to think critically and how to be compassionate and understanding. It helps us to become more aware of the world around us and to appreciate the diversity of cultures and beliefs. Education is an ongoing process that helps us to grow and develop as individuals.

In addition, education is a process of self-discovery. As we learn more about ourselves and the world around us, we gain a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses. We learn how to make the most of our strengths and how to overcome our weaknesses. We also learn how to use our knowledge and skills to make a positive contribution to society.

Finally, education is a process of lifelong learning. We never stop learning, even when we are no longer in school. We can continue to learn new things through reading, attending lectures, and engaging in conversations with others. We can also take advantage of online resources, such as podcasts, blogs, and online courses, to further our knowledge and skills.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process. It helps us to develop our character and values, to discover ourselves, and to continue learning throughout our lives. Education is essential for personal growth and for making a positive contribution to society.

Firstly, education is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills in school or college. It is also about learning from our experiences, mistakes, and successes. We learn from our interactions with people, from the books we read, from the movies we watch, and from the places we visit. All these experiences contribute to our personal growth and development, and they help us become better individuals.

Secondly, the world is constantly changing, and we need to keep up with these changes to stay relevant. Technology, for instance, is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and we need to keep learning new skills to keep up with it. If we stop learning, we risk becoming obsolete and irrelevant in our careers and personal lives.

Thirdly, education helps us become more open-minded and tolerant. It exposes us to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking. This, in turn, helps us become more empathetic and understanding towards others, which is essential in today's globalized world.

Finally, education is not just about personal growth and development. It also has a broader societal impact. Educated individuals are more likely to be engaged citizens, who participate in their communities and contribute to the betterment of society. They are also more likely to be innovative and entrepreneurial, which can lead to economic growth and job creation.

In conclusion, education is indeed a lifelong process, and it is essential for personal growth, professional development, and societal progress. We should all strive to keep learning and growing throughout our lives, and never stop seeking knowledge and wisdom.

weccl_56,WECCL-28,"A recent study by Pew Research Center found that millennials (ages 18-35) are more likely than older generations to say they are “very happy” with their lives. While there are many possible explanations for this finding, I believe that there are several reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do.

First, young people are more likely to be in the early stages of their careers and have less responsibilities than older people do. This allows them to focus on the positives in their lives and enjoy experiences that are new and exciting. In contrast, older people may be more likely to be in the later stages of their careers and have more responsibilities, such as taking care of children or aging parents. This can lead to a more negative outlook on life and less time for enjoying experiences.

Second, young people are typically more optimistic than older people. They are more likely to see the glass as half full, rather than half empty. This positive attitude allows them to enjoy life more and appreciate the small things that happen every day. In contrast, older people may be more likely to have a negative outlook on life and be less likely to find joy in the simple things.

Finally, young people are typically more active than older people. They are more likely to participate in activities that they enjoy, such as sports, music, and dance. This allows them to stay healthy and physically active, which can also contribute to a more positive outlook on life. In contrast, older people may be more likely to be inactive and spend most of their time sitting around. This can lead to health problems and a less positive outlook on life.

Overall, I believe that there are several reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do. Their careers are usually less demanding, they are more optimistic, and they are more active.

They should not be subjected to unfair criticism or have their privacy invaded by the media.

In conclusion, I believe that famous people should not be treated unfairly by the media and should be given more privacy. They should be allowed to live their lives without fear of being judged or criticized by the public. They should be treated with respect and dignity, and their privacy should be respected.

weccl_71,WECCL-43,"The debate over whether famous people should be given more privacy or not is a contentious one. On one hand, some people argue that famous people should be given more privacy as they are often subject to intense media scrutiny, which can be detrimental to their mental health. On the other hand, some people argue that this is the price of fame and that they should accept the attention that comes with it. In my opinion, I agree that famous people should be given more privacy.

To begin with, famous people are often subject to intense media scrutiny, which can be detrimental to their mental health. This is because the media often publish stories about celebrities that are sensationalized and inaccurate. This can lead to celebrities being portrayed in a negative light and can have a detrimental effect on their mental health. For example, in 2017, the singer Selena Gomez was hospitalized due to her mental health being affected by the intense media scrutiny she was subject to. This is a clear example of how the media can have a negative effect on the mental health of celebrities.

Furthermore, famous people should be given more privacy as they are often subject to invasion of privacy. This is because the media often publish stories about celebrities that are based on information that was obtained without their consent. This can be extremely intrusive and can lead to celebrities feeling violated. For example, in 2018, the actress Jennifer Lawrence revealed that she had been the victim of an invasion of privacy when a hacker had stolen and published private photos of her without her consent. This is a clear example of how the media can invade the privacy of celebrities.

In conclusion, while some people argue that this is the price of fame, I believe that famous people should be given more privacy. This is because they are often subject to intense media scrutiny, which can be detrimental to their mental health, and they are often subject to invasion of privacy. Therefore, it is important that the media respect the privacy of celebrities and refrain from publishing stories that are sensationalized and inaccurate.

weccl_72,WECCL-44,"Famous people have always been in the limelight, and their every move is scrutinized by the media. While some people believe that celebrities deserve more privacy, others argue that it is the price they pay for their fame. In my opinion, I believe that famous people should be given some privacy, but they should also be prepared for the media attention that comes with their fame.

On the one hand, it is true that famous people deserve some privacy. Celebrities are human beings with emotions, and they have the right to keep some aspects of their lives private. The media often invades their personal space, publishing stories that are often untrue or exaggerated. This can be distressing for them and their families, leading to mental health issues like anxiety and depression. For instance, Princess Diana was relentlessly hounded by the paparazzi, which ultimately led to her tragic death in a car crash in Paris.

On the other hand, it is also true that being famous comes with a price. Celebrities are public figures, and they are in the public eye because of their talent, skills, or achievements. As such, they have a responsibility to their fans and the media to maintain a certain level of transparency. Moreover, the media attention often helps them to remain relevant and popular, which is crucial for their careers. For example, Taylor Swift is one of the most famous singers in the world, and her fans are always interested in her personal life. She has used this media attention to her advantage, promoting her music and building her brand.

In conclusion, while I believe that famous people deserve some privacy, they should also be prepared for the media attention that comes with their fame. They have a responsibility to maintain a certain level of transparency, and the media attention can help them to remain relevant and popular. However, the media should also respect their privacy and avoid publishing stories that are untrue or exaggerated. Ultimately, it is up to the celebrities to strike a balance between their personal and public lives.

weccl_73,WECCL-45,"Famous people are often the subject of media scrutiny, with their every move being monitored and reported on. While some people argue that this is unfair and that celebrities deserve more privacy, others believe that this is simply the price of their fame. In my opinion, I believe that famous people should be given more privacy, and I will outline my reasons below.

Firstly, celebrities are human beings just like the rest of us, and they deserve to have their privacy respected. While it is true that they have chosen a career in the public eye, this does not mean that they should be subjected to constant media attention. Everyone has a right to privacy, regardless of their profession or level of fame. It is unfair to expect celebrities to constantly be on display and to have their personal lives scrutinized by the media.

Secondly, the media often exaggerates or fabricates stories about celebrities in order to sell more newspapers or attract more viewers. This can have a damaging effect on their reputation and can lead to false rumors and speculation. This can be especially harmful when it comes to sensitive topics such as mental health or addiction, which are often sensationalized by the media. Famous people should be allowed to deal with these issues in private, without the added pressure of media attention.

Finally, the constant media attention can have a negative impact on the mental health of celebrities. Many famous people have spoken out about the toll that this can take on their mental wellbeing, with some even developing anxiety or depression as a result. This is not surprising, given that they are constantly under scrutiny and are often subjected to harsh criticism and judgment. By giving celebrities more privacy, we can help to protect their mental health and wellbeing.

In conclusion, while it is true that famous people have chosen a career in the public eye, this does not mean that they should be subjected to constant media attention. They deserve to have their privacy respected, just like anyone else. By giving them more privacy, we can help to protect their mental health and wellbeing, and ensure that they are not unfairly targeted by the media.
